Personal macros for Foundry-VTT

Owner: Zimm#2324

The file macros.db is a pre-made compendium with all macros v1.0 updated until 29-july-2020.

The macros that were found over internet and received only small tweaks (or not) are in a different folder.


Notes on compatibility
- All v1.0 macros were tested on Foundry v0.65 and v0.70 with System 5e v0.94
- Many of these macros requires the Module Token Magic: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/
    If you want to deactivate the effects, just set this to false: let effectsOn = true;
